ExcelRead
=========

<span class="recommendation">This function supports files that have been
created using Microsoft Excel 2007 or later (.xlsx file
extension). You do not need to have Excel installed to use this function.</span>

ExcelRead reads data from an Excel spreadsheet file.

Properties
----------

-  #### File path

    The file path of the xlsx file to read.

-  #### Read type

    **Read specific ranges**

    Range information should include enough sheet information to identify the sheet to read the data from. Omitting the sheet name or sheet index will read the data from the first sheet.

    **Read ranges in all worksheets**

    Range data will be read from all sheets filtered by the sheet name filter. Range information should not include any sheet names or indexes.

-  #### Sheet name filter
    
    This property is only available if Read type is "Read ranges in all worksheets". It takes a regular expression that filters the sheets that are read e.g. "^invoice" will only read data from sheets that starts with "invoice" - "invoice123" will be read and "fooinvoice" will be ignored.

-  #### Range

	The range property specifies an OutputName and a Range in the format {"OutputName":"Range1","Range":"Sheet1!A2:G4"}. Use the Range Editor to edit it. You can also specify multiple ranges. 

	OutputName can be any valid Linx name. 

	Range is specified using the [A1 reference style](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Overview-of-formulas-d258ec72-149a-42ac-8eae-b50a667eb491?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#bmusing_references_in_formulas),
    e.g. 'A1:D3', or 'Sheet3!B3'. You can also reference a sheet using its index e.g. '\\1!B3' will reference the first sheet in the workbook.

-  #### Loop results

    **Read type = Read specific ranges**

    This option is available when at least one of the ranges
    references multiple rows.

    If checked, the rows will be returned one at a time in a loop. If
    more than one range is specified, a separate loop is created for
    each range.

    If not checked, a list containing all the rows will be created. If
    more than one range is specified, one list for each range will be
    returned.

    **Read type = Read ranges in all worksheets**

    If checked, the sheets are returned one at a time in a loop.

    If not checked, a list containing all the sheets is created.
