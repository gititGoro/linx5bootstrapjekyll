Write CSV File
==============

This sample reads product information from the Northwind database and writes it to a CSV file. You can get sample Northwind databases [here](https://code.google.com/p/northwindextended/downloads/list).

This Linx Solution uses the **File**, **Database**, and **Utilities** plugins.

#### To run the sample

1. Open the WriteCSVFile solution with Linx Designer.
1. Click on the Settings button.
1. On the Settings tab change the values of the Settings to suit your environment (if you need help with the database connection string, have a look at [this help topic](https://linx.software/plugins/Database/Functions/ExecuteSQL/)).
1. Open the WriteCSVFile Process from the Solution Explorer pane on the left.
1. Click the Debug or Run buttons to run the Process.
