<h1>Checkbox List</h1>
<p>A Check box list renders a list of options and allows user to select multiple values. The values are passed through to the script as a comma separated list of selected values/texts. Use the <a href="../PageScripts/ForEach">ForEach</a> action to loop through the array of values and action them one at a time.
